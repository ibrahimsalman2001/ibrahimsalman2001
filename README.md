## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate with strong foundations in software development, backend systems, and applied Artificial Intelligence. Alongside my degree, I worked part-time as a **GenAI Developer at KRW**, where I helped build and deploy a **tax compliance chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

I enjoy working on real-world systems that require clean code, structured workflows, and reliable deployment — not just experimentation.
